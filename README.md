# todo-server-app
This repository contains a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and it leverages a server-side JavaScript file for fetching and storing the tasks. The server-side JavaScript handles API endpoints for adding, updating, and deleting tasks, and it uses "assignment9.json" as the data storage file. The user interface is designed with Bootstrap for a clean and user-friendly experience. The application's back-end and front-end work together seamlessly to provide a functional and responsive To-Do List.
